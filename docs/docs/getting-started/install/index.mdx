# Installation

For all the features to work properly, you should install two plugins:

1. An Obsidian plugin `obsidian-zotero-plugin`, which enables most of the functions like citation insertion, annotation view, etc.
   - Install Obsidian Plugin: <LatestBadge type="obsidian" href="./obsidian" alt="Obsidian Plugin Install Guide"/>
2. (Optional) A Zotero plugin `zotero-obsidian-note`, which allow you to open obsidian note linked to a Zotero item and export items to obsidian within Zotero.
   - Install Zotero Plugin: <LatestBadge type="zotero" href="./zotero" alt="Zotero Plugin Install Guide"/>

In addition, you can also install the following plugins to enhance your experience:

- [Zotero Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)
   - By default, the plugin insert citation with citekey generated by Better BibTex.
   I haven't tested other solution yet, but you can change the citation format in the plugin settings.
- [Zotfile](https://www.zotfile.com/)
   - You can save PDF to Obsidian vault, and the plugin will can generate a in-vault wikilink that you can open with obsidian
